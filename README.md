# Evaluation Paper
This repository contains the evaluation plan for assessing the changes implemented in the Patient Portal at [Your Healthcare Organization Name]. The plan outlines various metrics and evaluation phases to determine the impact of recent changes in the Patient Portal. The evaluation process involves immediate, three-month, and one-year assessments.

Evaluation Phases

Immediate Evaluation - Text Reminder for COVID-19 Booster Vaccination

- **Metric:** Accessibility of text reminders.
- **Rationale:** Ensure patients can receive text reminders and identify any system issues.

Immediate Evaluation - Request to Fill Patient Information Form

- **Metric:** Accessibility of patient information request forms.
- **Rationale:** Determine if patients can access the forms and identify any technical challenges.

Three Months After Implementation - Text Reminder for COVID-19 Booster Vaccination

- **Metric:** User adoption.
- **Rationale:** Evaluate how patients have perceived and adopted text reminders for scheduling appointments.

Three Months After Implementation - Request to Fill Patient Information Form

- **Metric:** User adoption.
- **Rationale:** Assess patient experiences with the request to fill information forms and identify any issues.

One Year After Implementation - Text Reminder for COVID-19 Booster Vaccination

- **Metric:** Effectiveness.
- **Rationale:** Determine if text reminders have led to increased vaccination appointments.

One Year After Implementation - Request to Fill Patient Information Form

- **Metric:** Effectiveness.
- **Rationale:** Assess the effectiveness of prefilling patient information forms and gather feedback from stakeholders.

Stakeholder Involvement

The evaluation process involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including:
- Hospital administrative board
- Project manager
- IT developer
- Physicians
- Nurses
- Clinical data analyst
- Patients

Stakeholder feedback is vital for shaping project objectives and outcomes.
